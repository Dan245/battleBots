# ICS4-Battlebots
Kudos to [ProfSamScott](https://github.com/ProfSamScott/BattleBots) for making this!

Each of my classmates and I made a bot to compete against each other in a death battle, my contribution is under [MamoBot.Java](https://github.com/Dan245/battleBots/blob/main/bots/MamoBot.java). 

The code isn't really annotated but you can find a copy of my report [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pTlbIay42FX0Rl50MheUOvDoPP_6jc-EXEmNEIbgbro/edit?usp=share_link) where I documented my progress.

There's no JAR file or anything so if you want to run the program yourself you'll need to download it as a zip and run it like any other java project in your IDE.
